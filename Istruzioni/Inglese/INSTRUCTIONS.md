Hello, Here I will briefly explain the functions of the Mod, in case something is not clear you could also contact me on telegram

### To make the mod work properly you need to set some files in the BAN_DATA folder that is in the main folder of Among.

### :star: Friends.txt
Here will go the account codes of the friends, they must be inserted with the command **/add (id)** and removed with **/dlt (id)**

---

### :star: Denyname.txt
Here you will have to manually insert the names that we do not want in the lobby (for example Turetta, Hitler etc)

---

### :star: BanWord.txt
Here we can add the forbidden words, insert them always in more formats (for example STUPID Stupid stupid) as for the Denyname.txt file (PHOTO ABOVE)

---

### :star: BanList.txt
Here you automatically add the players you ban and no longer want to enter your lobby, if you mistakenly add someone you don't want you have to delete them from the list manually.

### There are several commands, with the command **"/help"** you will get all the Info.
For each command or action a notification will appear on the left of the screen with the description of what is happening or in chat (visible only to you).

---

### commands /msg- /msgs-/msgw
To customize the commands with your messages you have to edit the template.dat file located in the language folder and insert your texts.
The template.dat file then rename it to English.dat
