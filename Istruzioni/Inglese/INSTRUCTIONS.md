<h1 align="center">INSTRUCTIONS</h1>

The mod can be activated and deactivated at your will, by default only the kick for banned words and for spam Start are always active, but you can always deactivate them.

To make the mod work properly you need to set some files in the BAN_DATA folder that is in the main folder of Among.
