### INFO


BanMod was created primarily because AmongUs has become a place full of rude players

or players who teamming ruining the game experience and the simple ban of among

is circumvented by simply changing the ip of the device!!!

---
> - You can also ban players during the game, do it only with valid reasons
> - Instantly bans access to lobbies to players with names you have banned
> - Instantly bans access to lobbies to players who are on the ban list or to players who are on the blocked list on Among.
> - Kick those who use banned words or who spam start, you can set from 1 to 3 allowed words before expulsion.
> - You have a countdown in the lobby to see how much time is left until the automatic closure (it may not be real,for example if you become a host after the last host has abandoned)
> - You can stop the game from starting if you accidentally pressed the Start button.
