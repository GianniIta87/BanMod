### INFO


BanMod was created primarily because AmongUs has become a place full of rude players

or players who teamming ruining the game experience and the simple ban of among

is circumvented by simply changing the ip of the device!!!

---
> - You can also ban players during the game, do it only with valid reasons
> - Instantly bans access to lobbies to players with names you have banned
> - Instantly bans access to lobbies to players who are on the ban list or to players who are on the blocked list on Among.
> - Kick those who use banned words or who spam start, you can set from 1 to 3 allowed words before expulsion.
> - You have a countdown in the lobby to see how much time is left until the automatic closure (it may not be real,for example if you become a host after the last host has abandoned)
> - You can stop the game from starting if you accidentally pressed the Start button.

- You can disable or enable lobby music
- You can kick your friends out of the kick for spam and swearing (Friends List.txt)
- You can enable chat warning for spam and swearing (WARNING, it can cause the host to be kicked out, I hope I have "solved" it, if you encounter problems I suggest you disable it and let me know here or on telegram [@GianniBart](https://t.me/Giannibart)

### New commands have been added
Commands must be written in chat and are 6

- /id : Show all player IDs on the left screen (only readable by you)
- /level (num) : Set your level, from 1 to 999 (only readable by you)
- /add (id) : Add a friend to the Friends.txt list (only readable by you)
- /dlt (id): Remove a friend from the Friends.txt list (only readable by you)
- /spam : Send a message in chat warning the player not to send spam start (readable by everyone)
- /word : Send a message in chat warning the player not to use forbidden words (readable by everyone)

---

### WARNING
The automatic spam warning in chat has been changed to prevent kicking, it will not warn for every word, but only the first time
You can send a predefined message using /spam or /word to the player who breaks the rules.

/spam and /word commands must be used with a delay of at least 3 seconds from the last message sent in chat. Sending multiple messages without waiting may cause the host to be kicked.

The updated code files are lost, as soon as I can rewrite them I will add them to the repository, please be patient.
